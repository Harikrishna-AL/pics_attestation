                        <!-- <p style="color: black;"> -->
                        <p style="color: black;">
                            In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), certificate equivalency is referred to as foreign
                            educational qualification recognition which is the assessment of the foreign qualifications
                            to identify their compatibility with domestic qualifications. This process is used to
                            approve foreign qualification education attained by people seeking to have their education
                            recognized in UAE.

                            The process of getting a certificate equivalency in the UAE is a practical process involving
                            documents preparation and attestation, submission, and evaluation by the Ministry of
                            Education. It also guarantees that foreign qualifications are accredited and can fulfil the
                            required standards for educational and career purposes within the UAE.
                        </p>
                        <h4><b>The purpose of Certificate equivalency in UAE is as follows:</b></h4>
                        <p style="color: black;">
                            The purpose of certificate equivalency in the UAE is to promote and maintain standard
                            fairness when it comes to the recognition of foreign qualifications. In this way, the UAE
                            aligns the acquired standards with the international ones, enabling the holders of the
                            degrees or qualifications received in the foreign country, to be integrated into the UAE
                            workforce.


                        </p>
                        <h4><b>Documents that are needed when applying for Certificate equivalency in UAE include:</b>
                        </h4>

                        <!-- <p style="color: black;">It is also known as non-educational document Attestation.
                            Non-educational documents include birth certificates, death certificates, employment
                            certificates, divorce certificates, marriage certificates, and others.

                            The process for non-educational certifications is the same as for educational certificate
                            attestation services.</p>
                        <h4><b>Commercial certificate attestation</b></h4>
                        <p style="color: black;">It is required for commercial documents like certificates of origin,
                            certificates of incorporation, and so forth for people who want to conduct business
                            internationally.

                            The procedure in this scenario is very different from the processes used in the other two
                            types of certificate attestation.</p>

                        <p style="color: black;">A person who wants to work or study abroad must obtain certificate
                            attestation services. Every time, the process is different by regional regulations. Any
                            attestation's main objective is to establish the authenticity of the document.</p> -->

                        <h4><b>The certificate equivalency process in the UAE involves the following steps:</b></h4>
                        <p style="color: black;">
                            Application: Through this, the foreign qualifications recognition allows the applicant to
                            fill forms which should be forwarded to the appropriate body in the UAE.
                            Assessment: Some of the processes include a recognition assessment that seeks to give an
                            idea whether the overseas qualifications meet the standard as provided by the UAE’s
                            regulatory bodies. This can involve the assessment of the academic records, curriculum, and
                            the performance on the exams by the student.
                            Equivalency Decision: Depending on the evaluation results, the concerned body make a
                            decision of whether the foreign qualification can be considered as a domestic equivalent.
                            This decision is informed by aspects such as the subject matter, the length of the course as
                            well as the study level.
                            Certification: If the foreign qualification is considered equivalent, the authority
                            furnishes a certificate of equivalency specifying qualifications acquired.
                            Employment: The equivalency certificate is handy when it comes to job hunting or status or
                            even when one wishes to further his or her education in the UAE. It assists people in
                            proving to employers and institutions of learning of their capabilities in the job market.
                        </p>

                        <h4><b>Certificate equivalency in the UAE offers several advantages:</b></h4>
                        <p style="color: black;">
                            Access to employment opportunities: It enables those people who have acquired their
                            qualifications overseas to have an equal chance with other people from within the country.
                            UAE in particular has a very diverse economy that provide different employment
                            opportunities. It performs in different industries such as oil & gas, construction,
                            accommodation & food service, banking & finance, stores & other commercial real estate and
                            more.

                            The government also encourages foreigners to seek employment in the country through use of
                            incentives. In order to secure decent employment opportunities in the UAE, the persons can
                            focus on improving upon their skills through certain professional development courses or
                            certification programs which are applicable to certain sectors of the individual’s
                            respective interests.
                            <br><br>
                            Transferability: The equivalency certificate arises to assure the public that the foreign
                            education achievements are recognized and transferable within the country.
                            Enhanced career prospects: Equivalency certificates help open up the sector to the
                            individual by allowing them to prove a point that they are qualified to do the job.
                            Educational progression: The main reason for issuing equivalency certificates is to ease the
                            process of admission of foreign-trained candidates to higher learning institutions in the
                            UAE.

                            Professional Licensing: Many professional organizations as well as professional regulatory
                            organizations in various sectors such as health care, engineering and teaching demand
                            equivalency certificates with a view to licensing professionals.

                            Legal and Administrative Recognition: The equivalency certificate enables authorities to
                            give an official recognition to foreign qualifications hence making the legal and
                            administrative procedures less complicated.

                            Golden Visa: Golden visa refers to a form of residency that is granted to investors along
